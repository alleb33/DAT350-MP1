# MP1: Getting Data Driven Answers from Surveys

## Overview

This project analyzes survey data collected on exercise habits among college students. The goal of the assignment was to design a survey, collect responses, analyze the data using Python, and tell a data-driven story addressing the *who, what, when, where, and why* of the topic.

Survey responses were collected using Google Forms, exported as a CSV file, and analyzed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.

## Research Question

How do college students engage in exercise, and what factors influence the type, timing, location, and motivation behind their exercise habits?

---

## Data Collection

* The survey was created using **Google Forms**
* Distributed online through class group chats and personal networks
* **16 participants** completed the survey
* Responses were collected anonymously with a disclaimer stating the data would be shared with the instructor
* Data was exported as a **CSV file** for analysis

## Tools & Libraries Used

* Python 3
* pandas
* matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Forms (data collection)

## Analysis Summary

The analysis explores:

* **Who** participated (age range, academic year, gender identity)
* **What** types of exercise participants engage in
* **When** participants exercise and how frequently
* **Where** participants typically exercise
* **Why** participants choose to exercise, their timing, and locations

Percentages were calculated for all survey questions. For multi-select questions, percentages represent the proportion of participants who selected each option.

---

## Key Findings

* Most participants exercise multiple days per week
* Walking, strength training, and intensive cardio were the most common exercise types
* Exercise timing and location were strongly influenced by convenience
* Physical health, appearance, and mental health were the primary motivations for exercising
* Lack of time and motivation were the most common barriers to exercising more often

---

## Limitations

* Small sample size
* Participants were primarily college students in similar age ranges
* All data was self-reported

Future studies could include a larger and more diverse population and collect numerical measures such as workout duration or exercise intensity.
